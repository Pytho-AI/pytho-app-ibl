"""Intelligence Estimate — ATP 2-33.4 App. E paras E-5 – E-6, Figure E-2.

Doctrine source: ATP 2-33.4 (INCL C1) Appendix E (Intelligence Production),
paragraphs E-5 and E-6, with the published format example in Figure E-2
(page E-4). This product is Appendix 1 to Annex B (Intelligence) of the
operation order — it is the MDMP-time formal estimate that supports COA
development, distinct from the periodic INTSUM (Fig E-4) and from the
continuously-updated Intelligence Running Estimate (Fig E-3).

Per E-5: "An intelligence estimate is the appraisal, expressed in writing
or orally, of available intelligence relating to a specific situation or
condition with a view of determining the courses of action open to the
enemy or adversary and the order of probability of their adoption (JP 2-0).
Since intelligence analysts will have performed IPB to support the
commander's MDMP effort and likely participated in a thorough staff
war-gaming effort to validate friendly and threat COAs, the intelligence
estimate is a version of the staff planning effort and part of the larger
OPORD."

ATP 2-33.4 publishes NO acronym for this product type. The registry key
is "Intelligence Estimate" (full doctrinal name) and the class identifier
in this module is `IntelligenceEstimate` — the schema must not invent
an acronym (e.g. IE / IEST) that doctrine does not use.
