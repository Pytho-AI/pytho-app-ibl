"""Restricted Target List (RTL) — ; FM 3-60 paras 1-11 / 1-13.

The RTL is a list of VALID targets that have specific restrictions placed on
the actions authorized against them (JP 3-60 GL-6 'restricted target',
'restricted target list'). Actions exceeding the documented restrictions are
prohibited until coordinated and approved by the establishing HQ. Engaging
restricted targets without due regard for the specified restriction(s) may be
a violation of the law of war ().

Doctrinal acronym: RTL appears verbatim in JP 3-60 (GL-2 + GL-6 + III-13) and
in FM 3-60 (acronym list + paras 1-11 / 1-13).
