"""Event Template — ATP 2-01.3 Step 4 paras 6-64 to 6-71 + Figs 6-11/6-12/6-13.

5: "An event template is a guide for collection planning that depicts
the named areas of interest where activity, or lack of activity, will indicate
which course of action the enemy and/or adversary has adopted (JP 2-0). It is a
graphic overlay used during the COA analysis step of the MDMP to confirm or deny
threat COAs throughout war gaming."

6: the event template comprises three components — time-phase lines,
NAIs (with decision points), and the differentiating events that distinguish
between threat COAs. 7 the analyst compares NAIs/indicators across
the multiple SITEMP-derived COAs and identifies the differences that provide
the most reliable indications of COA adoption (Fig 6-11 construction; Fig 6-12
completed example).

The Event Template carries an associated Event Matrix 0 — a
cross-referenced description of indicators and activity expected at each NAI
(Fig 6-13). The matrix lives as a paragraph_field on this same product so the
graphic + matrix render together 3.

The Event Template + Matrix are the consolidation layer between the per-COA
SITEMPs (which carry standalone NAIs/DPs) and the downstream Decision Support
Template + Information Collection Matrix (paras 6-71 – 6-72).
