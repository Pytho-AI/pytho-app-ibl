"""LOS — Line-of-Sight Analysis — ATP 3-34.80 §B.

Tier 1 GEOINT / geospatial-engineering single-INT product. Visibility
analysis between observer / sensor positions and target positions,
accounting for terrain elevation, vegetation, and urban masking. Used
to support: patrol-route observation overlays, fire-support observer /
firing-point templating, ADA radar / EW sensor coverage envelopes, NSL
protected-site LOS deconfliction.

Per ATP 3-34.80 Table 4-6, LOS analysis touches every warfighting
function — Movement and Maneuver (patrol routes, ambush positions),
Fires (observer / firing points), Protection (visibility for force
protection), Command and Control (positioning C2 nodes), Intelligence
(ISR sensor placement).

See templates/__init__.py for the assembled PRODUCT_SCHEMAS map.
