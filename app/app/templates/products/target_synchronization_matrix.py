"""TSM — Target Synchronization Matrix — paras 2-27 – 2-28 + App. D Table D-4.

Final Decide-phase product. Integrates the D3A picture: each HPT row maps to
specific DETECT agencies/assets, DELIVER agencies/assets, and ASSESS agencies/
assets — synchronizing collection, fires, and BDA across the targeting cycle
(paras 2-27 – 2-28, App. D paras D-11 – D-13). The TSM also serves as
the basis for updating the information collection plan and issuing the
fragmentary order after the targeting working group / targeting board (para
D-11 last sentence).

Ch. 2 (paras 2-149+) and Ch. 3 corroborate TSM as a fires-cell
product the DIVARTY targeting officer drafts; this schema is echelon-agnostic.
