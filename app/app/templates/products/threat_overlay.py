"""Threat Overlay — Step-3 / §B-18 doctrinal Threat Template (DOCTEMP).

Per ATP 2-01.3 §4 + §B-18 the Threat Overlay is the doctrinal threat
template for the operation: formation-relative depiction of how the
threat force is doctrinally arrayed, generic-terrain (no MGRS), no
friendly C2, no scenario-specific catalog pickups. The Step-4 SITEMP
downstream adjusts this template onto OE-specific terrain (MGRS-
positioned, per-COA).

This artifact OWNS the forward BP belt centerline AS DATA — published
as a generic-terrain LineString in the forward_bp_belt paragraph_field,
consumed by the SITEMP at per-COA template time (the SITEMP picks BP
catalog ids from scenario.TERRAIN.battle_positions and reads geometry
from the catalog; this threat-template artifact authors the doctrinal
centerline that the catalog entries are arrayed against).

DESIGN FOLLOWUP — do NOT silently add LLM-emitted polygon overlays.
Hard constraint: no LLM-emitted spatial coordinates anywhere. If real
Threat Overlay overlay layers are desired on the master map, schema-
migrate as follows:

  - forward_bp_belt rows as LineString overlay features (centerline
    polyline + named occupant) BUT ONLY by referencing scenario / catalog
    geometry by id — never writer-emit coordinates.
  - weapon-range rings tied to row_fields[].weapon_range_kilometers as
    range_fan overlays at the unit's MGRS (read from scenario.KG_OOB
    unit catalog by row_fields[].id).
  - collection_nais polygons as named_area_of_interest overlays with
    attrs.source='Threat Overlay' BY REFERENCE to scenario NAI
    catalog.

writer_overlays will then flow through the existing
_push_overlays_to_master_map path under source='Threat Overlay'. The
writer LLM does NOT emit ad-hoc polygon coordinates under any
circumstance.
