"""OE Definition — IPOE Step 1 — ATP 2-01.3 Ch. 3.

Doctrine source: ATP 2-01.3 Chapter 3 (paras 3-1 – 3-25, Figs 3-1 and 3-2),
with the operational-variable lens extended per FM 3-0 paras 1-125 – 1-126
(PMESII-PT 8-lens) and the mission-variable lens per FM 6-0 / FM 3-0 para
1-126 (METT-TC). ATP 2-01.3 does not publish an acronym for this product
type; the registry key is "Operational Environment Definition" (full doctrinal name).

This is the FIRST product in any IPOE analytical chain. Every downstream
IPOE product (MCOO, TEM, WEM, CCA, Threat Overlay, SITEMP, Threat COA Statement, threat family, etc.)
cites the OE Definition's AO, AOI, and significant-characteristics list as
its scoping input. Without an OE Definition, downstream products have to
re-derive scope from the OPORD on every cycle.
