"""ICSM — Information Collection Synchronization Matrix — ATP 2-01 / FM 3-55.

Tier 2 fused product. Sibling to ICM (Information Collection Matrix):
ICM declares WHAT collection is tasked per PIR; ICSM synchronizes WHEN
each collection task fires across the operational timeline so that
collection feeds intersect decision points before the commander needs
to decide. Per ATP 2-01.3 the ICSM is named alongside the Event
Template and DST as the time-synchronization companion to the ICM.

See templates/__init__.py for the assembled PRODUCT_SCHEMAS map.
