"""Collateral Damage Estimate (CDE) — JP 3-60 Ch. III §C para 3.c(6); FM 3-60 paras 2-59 – 2-61.

CDE is the joint-force methodology for estimating unintentional or incidental
injury or damage to persons or objects that would not be lawful military
targets in the circumstances ruling at the time (JP 3-60 GL-5 'collateral
damage' definition). It assists the commander in weighing collateral risk
against military necessity and is a required input to the Phase 3 Capabilities
Analysis step of the joint targeting cycle (JP 3-60 Ch. III §C para 3.c(6)),
required for ALL TARGETS that have a weaponeering solution per JP 3-60 Ch. III
§D para 3.d(6)(a)(3): 'A CDE for lethal effects and a CEE for lethal and
nonlethal effects are required for all targets that have a weaponeering
solution.'

Doctrinal acronym: CDE appears verbatim in JP 3-60 (acronym list at JP 3-60
glossary GL-1 'CDE — collateral damage estimation'), in FM 3-60 (acronym list
at FM 3-60 glossary 'CDE — collateral damage estimation'), and throughout
both pubs.

The CDE-1 → CDE-5 progression (informally 'CDE levels' or 'CDE phases') is
defined in CJCSI 3160.01D, (U) No-Strike and the Collateral Damage Estimation
Methodology — a CUI publication not consumed by this agent. Per JP 3-60 Ch. II
para 4.d and Ch. III §C para 3.c(6), CDE is normally performed by trained and
certified personnel. The agent's role here is to PRE-FILL the inputs the
certified CDE analyst needs — target identity, aimpoint, weapon proposal,
collateral-environment characterization, NSL proximity — and to capture the
CDE OUTPUTS (recommended CDE level, mitigation measures, approval-authority
routing) after the certified analyst completes the methodology. Per JP 3-60
Ch. III §C para 3.c(6), 'The commander assumes additional risk if trained and
certified personnel are not used.'
