"""Threat COAs — Step-4 published deliverable per the IBL example exhibit.

Combines Threat COA Statement (analytical text per COA) + per-COA SITEMP
(templated graphic for each COA) into a single landscape PPTX with one
slide per COA. Each slide matches the layout in the IBL example pack
(scratch/docs/ibl/event_samples/IPSR03_B_16_Exh_03D01_Threat_COAs_OPORD_*
.pptx):

Threat COA Statement stays as the upstream analytical DOCX (six basic
questions, validity criteria, per-COA HVT lists). SITEMP per-COA stays
as the upstream graphic. Threat COAs is the consolidated commander-
facing PPTX that fuses them. Per the doctrinal example this is the
deliverable an analyst hands the commander.

The map for each slide is looked up at RENDER time from the per-COA
SITEMP artifact (matched by coa_id) — no back-fill, no in-place patch
of Threat COA Statement. The exporter does the lookup when emitting
the slide.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Threat COAs PPTX is a LAYOUT TRANSFORMER of upstream Threat COA
# Statement + per-COA SITEMP. Every subfield that mirrors an upstream
# field declares from:/path: keys to mechanically carry through; no
# LLM re-derivation. Subfields that don't mirror upstream are slide-
# format-specific and writer-LLM-authored.
#
# from:/path: grammar (canonical-on-disk resolver):
#   "from": "<UpstreamProductName>"   # e.g. "Threat COA Statement"
#   "path": "<json_path>"             # e.g. "coas[<index>].<field>"
#
# json_path supports:
#   - dot-walk: "header.coa_id"
#   - list-index by paragraph-iteration: "coas[<index>].<field>"
#       (the resolver iterates the upstream list and emits one slide
#       per upstream entry; <index> binds to the iteration cursor)
#   - list-lookup by subfield value:
#       "SITEMP[header.coa_id=<this.coa_id>]"
#       (the resolver scans the upstream list for the matching item)
#
# Subfield resolution runs POST-LLM-emit — the writer's emitted value
# for the subfield is overwritten by the mechanically-resolved value
# when the upstream payload yields a non-None result. The resolver
# routes every load through schema_state.json on disk so analyst edits
# to the upstream artifact (persisted by the finalize trigger) flow
# into downstream products on the next regenerate.
