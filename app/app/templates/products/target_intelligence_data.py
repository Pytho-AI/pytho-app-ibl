"""TIDAT — Target Intelligence Data Report — FM 34-25-3 Ch. 5
(All-Source Analysis System / Analysis and Control Element).

Doctrinal intel-to-fires per-target handoff. The ACE targeting workstation
analyst sends a TIDAT message carrying ONE validated target electronically to
the FSE via CCS or CAMPS, where it is forwarded to AFATDS for action.
AFATDS terminates per-target — each target is an independent fire-mission
record — and the FM 6-30 / ATP 3-09.30 call-for-fire structure is per-target,
so TIDAT is per-target as well. One right-click on a hostile mil_unit on the
operations map yields one TIDAT artifact for that one target.

Per FM 34-25-3 Ch. 5 verbatim:

  "Targets determined to be valid, accurate, and timely are sent
   electronically to the FSE using a target intelligence data (TIDAT)
   report."

  "The targeting workstation analyst sends a TIDAT message to the CCS or
   CAMPS. The TIDAT is then forwarded to the AFATDS for action."

Family: targeting Deliver-phase per-target message form, alongside HPTL
(rollup of which targets matter), AGM (engagement decision rules), TSS
(validity thresholds), TMP (mensurated aimpoint data sheet).

Shape: header_only DOCX, portrait. Closest analog in this codebase is
target_material_production.py (TMP) — per-target header_only DOCX with the
same single-document analyst surface, same per-target identity, same
downstream-by-id consumption. NOT a row-XLSX rollup; HPTL is the rollup.

Provenance and chain-of-custody for "where did this target come from"
lives in originating_cell (the ACE / G-2 desk that pushed the TIDAT) +
detection_source (the sensor / SIGINT / IMINT / HUMINT vertex that
established the target) + prepared_by (the analyst running the workstation).
TIDAT does not carry the FM 6-30 / ATP 3-09.30 "Observer Identification"
element — it originates at the ACE targeting workstation, not at a forward
observer.
