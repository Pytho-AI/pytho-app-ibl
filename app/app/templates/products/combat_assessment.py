"""CA — Combat Assessment — FM 3-60 paras 2-70 – 2-82; JP 3-60 App. C; CJCSI 3162.02.

Doctrine: 'Combat assessment is the determination of the overall effectiveness of
force employment during military operations' (JP 3-60 + FM 3-60 glossary, 'Also
called CA'). Per FM 3-60 para 2-70, CA elements are BDA + MEA + Reattack
Recommendation (Army 3-element) or those three + CDA (Joint 4-element). Per
the 2026-05-13 product audit, MEA and Reattack Recommendation are CA SECTIONS,
not standalone products: 'The operations officer ... CONDUCTS munitions
effectiveness assessment' (para 2-80) is an activity that gets written up
into CA; the Reattack Recommendation (para 2-82) 'requires a decision' that
is captured as a CA section.

BDA remains a standalone product (per-target / per-engagement; can fire on its
own cycle). CA references BDA artifacts; MEA and RR live INSIDE CA as
per-engagement paragraph_fields plus aggregate rollups.
