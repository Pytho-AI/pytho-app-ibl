"""TSS — Target Selection Standards — paras 2-16 – 2-18 + App. D Table D-2.

D3A Decide-phase product. TSS are the gating criteria the FSE + intelligence
section agree on so a battlefield acquisition can be declared a TARGET (vs a
SUSPECTED TARGET that still needs confirmation)6. Different TSS
may exist for the same enemy activity against different weapon systems
(para 2-18 — e.g., 150 m TLE for cannon artillery vs 1 km for attack aircraft).

paras 1-38 + 1-65 + Table 3-2 corroborate the matrix as a
DIVARTY-level S-2 targeting section product; this schema is echelon-agnostic
and the preparing_unit header field carries the actual owner.

# Doctrinal TSS column axis. Per para 2-17 the criteria are TLE
# (accuracy), size, status, timeliness. Para 2-19 adds reliability (the FAIO
# evaluates the source of the information as to its reliability and accuracy
# before declaring it a target). The schema renders four columns:
#   - accuracy_required_tle  (7 first bullet)
#   - timeliness             (7 fourth bullet)
#   - reliability            (9 — source reliability + verification)
#   - prioritization         (TSS gating priority — drives downstream AGM ordering;
#                              corresponds to the analyst's per-target prioritization
#                              note that overlays the HPTL priority for TSS purposes)
#
# Size + status are captured as separate scalar inputs in the row dict so the
# analyst sees them per-HPT alongside the four primary columns; they print
