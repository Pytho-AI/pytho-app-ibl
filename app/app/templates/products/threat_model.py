"""Threat Model — ATP 2-01.3 Step 3 (Evaluate the Threat) paras 5-45 – 5-46.

The doctrinal Step-3 threat description. Per para 5-45 the threat model
consists of three activities: (1) convert threat doctrine / patterns of
operations to graphics — the threat template (DOCTEMP); (2) describe the
threat's preferred tactics, options, and peculiarities; (3) identify HVTs.
This schema renders all three as one product per Fig 5-4.

Per the 2026-05-13 product audit, the Threat Template graphic (formerly a
standalone product) is folded into the Threat Model as the
threat_template_graphic section — it is sub-component (1) of the three
activities per para 5-45, not a separate deliverable. The HVT list remains
standalone (HVTL — Fig 5-7) since it is also referenced by the targeting
chain downstream of the Threat Model.
