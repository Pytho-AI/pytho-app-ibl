"""Decision Support Template (DST) + matrix — ATP 2-01.3 Step 4 para 6-72 + Fig 6-14.

Per para 6-72: "The DST provides the commander with a structured basis for
deploying fires, maneuver, and jamming assets and for reducing the enemy's
defensive capability with these assets. Simply stated, it provides commanders
with the specific points on the battlefield where they will be required to
make decisions regarding the employment of assets. These decisions can be
keyed to phase lines, events on the ground, or to specific enemy actions."

Per para 6-71 the DST is built from the completed Event Template + Event
Matrix (this product's upstream). Together with the Information Collection
Matrix it forms the Step-4 IPOE consolidation layer between SITEMP/Threat COA Statement and
the OPORD's collection tasking (Annex L).

The DST is a graphic + a matrix per Fig 6-14 — both render together on this
product (template = graphic overlay, matrix = paragraph_field).
