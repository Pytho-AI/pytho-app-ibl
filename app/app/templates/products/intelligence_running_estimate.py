"""Intelligence Running Estimate — ATP 2-33.4 App. E paras E-7 – E-9, Figure E-3.

Doctrine source: ATP 2-33.4 (INCL C1) Appendix E (Intelligence Production),
paragraphs E-7, E-8, E-9 and the published format example in Figure E-3
(page E-5). Per ADP 5-0 (cited in E-7), a running estimate is "the
continuous assessment of the current situation used to determine if the
current operation is proceeding according to the commander's intent and
if the planned future operations are supportable." The intelligence
running estimate is the intelligence-staff portion of that continuous
assessment.

Per E-8: "Unlike other intelligence products, the intelligence running
estimate combines both the analysis of friendly and allied forces'
intelligence activities to support current operations."

Per E-9: "The analysis focuses on current threat activities, strengths,
and assessed intent/objectives to provide the commander and associated
reporting requirements with a consistent summary of the threat. As the
operation progresses, the collaborative effort may involve further
analysis of the terrain and weather, monitoring the flow of displaced
persons on the battlefield as inhibitors to friendly force maneuverability,
and, when necessary, additional security requirements."

Doctrinal note in E-9: "In the highly volatile large-scale ground combat
environment, the intelligence operational officer along with the
all-source intelligence analyst are likely to maintain the running
estimate."

ATP 2-33.4 publishes NO acronym for this product type. The registry key
is "Intelligence Running Estimate" (full doctrinal name) and the class
identifier in this module is `IntelligenceRunningEstimate` — the schema
must not invent an acronym (e.g. IRE) that doctrine does not use.
