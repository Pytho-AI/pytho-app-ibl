"""CCM — Cross-Country Mobility Overlay — ATP 3-34.80 §B.

Tier 1 GEOINT / geospatial-engineering single-INT product. Per-vehicle-
class trafficability overlay derived from terrain primitives (slope,
soils, vegetation, hydrology) plus weather modifiers (wet-soil
trafficability degradation from the latest WEM). Distinct from MCOO's
coarse 3-class mobility shading — the standalone CCM is finer-grained
and produced by the geospatial engineer in support of movement and
maneuver, fires repositioning, and sustainment routing.

Per ATP 2-01.3: MCOO doctrinally INCORPORATES the CCM as an input layer
but is DISTINCT from it. MCOO is the combined overlay; CCM is the
trafficability primitive.
