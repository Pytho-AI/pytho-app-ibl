"""Information Collection Matrix — ATP 2-01.3 Step 4 paras 6-71 to 6-72 + Fig 6-15.

Per para 6-71: "The completed event template and event matrix form the basis
for planning collection strategies, synchronizing intelligence with friendly
operations, and developing the DST and matrix and information collection
matrix (see figure 6-14 and figure 6-15)."

Per Fig 6-15 the information collection matrix tabulates the PIRs from the
OPORD against the doctrinal collection columns — indicators, specific
information requirement (SIR), NAI / TAI, start / stop time windows, the
collection assets (capable / tasked-primary / tasked-alternate / requested
per asset), the decision points fed, and the target area of interest count.

This product is the consolidation layer that bridges Step-4 IPOE outputs
(SITEMP NAIs / DPs, Event Template indicators, DST decision points) into
the OPORD Annex L collection tasking. Doctrinally it sits SIBLING to the
DST under the Event Template + Matrix (para 6-71).
