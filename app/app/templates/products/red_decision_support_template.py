"""Threat (Red) Decision Support Template — ATP 2-01.3 Step 4 + ATP 2-01.3
para 6-72 analogue, applied to the THREAT commander.

This is the red-perspective mirror of decision_support_template.py. Where the
(blue) DST plots FRIENDLY commander decisions triggered BY enemy activity, this
product plots THREAT commander decisions triggered BY FRIENDLY activity:

  "6 threat decision points predict where the THREAT commander must decide on a
   particular COA — this is doctrinally distinct from friendly DPs and helps
   friendly forces drive when/where the threat must decide."
       — event_template.py subtleties (the threat-DP set this product expands)

The friendly DST answers "where must MY commander decide?". The red DST answers
"where must the ENEMY commander decide, and what friendly action forces that
decision?" — so the friendly staff can template the threat's decision logic and
drive (or pre-empt) it. Decisions are keyed to the same three trigger types
(phase lines, ground events, friendly actions) but read from the Donovian /
threat commander's seat.

Upstream is the Threat COA Statement (the threat COAs whose decision logic this
templates), the per-COA SITEMPs (the threat scheme of maneuver the DPs sit on),
and the Event Template's threat-decision-point section. Unlike the blue DST,
this product is text/matrix only — NO map. The substance is the threat-DP
matrix (DP × trigger × threat-decision × options × effect-on-threat-COA). A
threat-perspective graphic already lives on the SITEMP / Threat Overlay (both
red), so the red DST does not re-plot one.

The `scenario.py` source file is NEVER modified — this is a schema definition
consumed by the product writer / DAG runner.

See templates/__init__.py for the assembled PRODUCT_SCHEMAS map. The friendly
companion lives in decision_support_template.py.
