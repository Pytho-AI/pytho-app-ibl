"""SIGSUM — SIGINT Summary — organizer-provided minimum standard.

Tier 1 SIGINT analytical product. Periodic windowed rollup of SIGINT
activity in the deep area, organized by warfighting function. Mirrors
INTSUM cadence on the SIGINT side. The 24-hour version is a doctrinal
division-level briefing artifact.

Doctrinal anchor: ATP 2-22.6 SIGINT TTPs (off-disk on unclassified
systems); the on-disk authority is the IDX 26 organizer template at
scratch/docs/ibl/event_docs/Example of SIGSUM and KLIEGLIGHT.docx
(treated as the minimum standard per the integration plan). FM 2-0 §1-86
lists SIGINT periodic reports as a product category.
