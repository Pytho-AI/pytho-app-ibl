"""Threat COA Statement — ATP 2-01.3 Step 4.

User-facing name: "Threat COA Statement" (renamed from the legacy
"Enemy Course of Action" tag on 2026-05-30 — the artifact's purpose
is the per-COA threat statement, and "threat" aligns with the rest of
the IPOE Step-3/4 vocabulary). The PRODUCT_SCHEMAS key stays
`Threat COA Statement` because consumers reference it everywhere as
`ref:Threat COA Statement` and as a filename prefix on disk — renaming
the key would break artifact lookup across the registry, depends_on
edges, and the autodraft directory layout. Display strings (SPEC["name"],
PRODUCT_LONG_NAMES["Threat COA Statement"], the writer's system prompt)
carry the new name.

Doctrinally a "course of action" is singular even when the artifact
enumerates multiple COAs (per ATP 2-01.3 para 6-35: minimum
most-likely + most-dangerous). The product type uses the singular form.

Schema architecture: the COA-set configuration (count, per-rank roles,
per-rank narrative-doctrine bindings, doctrinal invariants) lives in
`SPEC["product_config"]["coa_set"]`. The block is the per-exercise /
per-commander knob; it is the surface a runtime config UI binds to.
The schema's hard_rules + guidance reference the config block by name,
never by value — no count, no rank-to-flag mapping, no unit name is
hard-coded into the rules.

        "product consumes (see consumes_artifacts), the OOB row(s) "
        "for each committed formation, and the recent-activity / "
        "FRAGO / observation entries that distinguish THIS COA from "
        "a generic doctrinal recital.",

        # ---- Coverage (reads from product_config.coa_set) ----
        "Coverage: emit EXACTLY product_config.coa_set.count COAs in "
        "rank order. Each emitted COA carries the role + flag_fields "
        "+ narrative_doctrine_ref from "

        "boolean fields on the COA row to set True (e.g., "
        "most_likely / most_dangerous / most_deceptive), and "
        "narrative_doctrine_ref (when non-None) names the additional "
        "doctrine artifact whose narrative worksheet applies for "
        "this rank. The doctrinal floor per ATP 2-01.3 ¶6-35 (at "
        "minimum most-likely + most-dangerous) is enforced as a "
        "config invariant via "
        "product_config.coa_set.doctrinal_required_flags; the writer "
        "does not need to re-check it. Cross-COA invariants: all "
        "rank values across the emitted set MUST be distinct "
        "integers in product_config.coa_set.ranks; at most one COA "

        "COA carries two flags from the same entry in "
        "product_config.coa_set.doctrinal_mutually_exclusive_flag_sets.",

        # ---- Doctrinal grounding (principle, not answer) ----
        "Each COA MUST apply a distinct doctrinal pattern drawn from "
        "the COA pattern family in the threat-doctrine artifact this "
        "product consumes. For each COA, _provenance MUST cite (a) "
        "the doctrinal pattern name + the section of the doctrine "
        "artifact where it is described, and (b) the OOB-derived "
        "unit assignment (action force, enabling force(s), reserve, "
        "fires, C2) the COA commits to that pattern. The schema does "
        "NOT name which doctrinal pattern fills which rank, and does "
        "NOT name any unit — the writer makes the picks from threat "
        "doctrine + observed activity + the OE per ATP 2-01.3 ¶6-35. "
        "For offensive COAs the action_force is typically the lead "
        "echelon committed to the decisive task; for defensive COAs "
        "the action_force is typically the formation holding the "
        "decisive terrain — the writer applies the principle to "
        "THIS doctrine artifact's pattern menu.",

        # ---- Distinguishability (do not copy doctrine verbatim) ----
        "Do NOT copy the doctrine artifact verbatim into a COA. The "

        "functional_allocation / objectives MUST be specific to "
        "THIS scenario in a way that would NOT survive a search-and-"
        "replace of the threat force name or AO. A COA whose "

        "pattern description (no AO-specific terrain, no phase-"
        "specific timing, no OE-specific shift from the artifact's "
        "default behavior) is a writer bug — fail the COA, not the "
        "rule.",

        # ---- Most-deceptive COA structural framework ----
        "When a COA in the set carries most_deceptive=True (a flag "
        "set per product_config.coa_set — the rank entry whose "
        "flag_fields contains 'most_deceptive'), that COA MUST "

        "sourced from the narrative_doctrine_ref bound to that rank "
        "(or from the base threat-doctrine artifact's deception "
        "chapter if no narrative-doctrine reference is bound) and "
        "adapted to ATP 2-01.3 Step-4 product shape: "
        "(1) FALSE READ — what the threat WANTS the friendly "
        "commander to believe (which axis is decisive, which "
        "formation is the main effort, which timeline). Cite the "
        "friendly decision the false read is targeting. "
        "(2) DECEPTION ACTION — the observable activity the threat "
        "produces to sell the false read (demonstration on the non-"
        "decisive axis, dummy positions, decoy comms, demonstrative "
        "fires, civilian-pattern movement on the masked axis). State "
        "which activity is produced for friendly observation vs "
        "which activity is masked from observation. "
        "(3) MASS — where the real decisive effort actually lands "
        "once the friendly main effort commits to the false read, "
        "and the formation(s) that deliver it. (Unit designations "
        "are derived from OOB and cited in _provenance — the rule "
        "does NOT name the units.) "
        "(4) COMMITMENT TRIGGER — the observable event that releases "
        "the threat from deception phase into commitment phase "
        "(typically: friendly recon confirmation of the phantom main "
        "effort, friendly fires expended against decoy preparations, "
        "friendly reserve committed against the spoof, or a fixed "
        "time horizon driven by threat logistics runtime). State the "
        "trigger as a specific friendly action or DTG window that an "
        "analyst can collect against. "
        "(5) SIGNATURE DISAMBIGUATION — for each of the COA's "
        "observable signatures, state whether it is GENUINE (the "
        "real action is reflected in this signature) or SPOOFED "
        "(the signature is produced for friendly consumption while "
        "the real action is elsewhere). This is the "
        "operationalization of validity-criterion-4 distinguishable "
        "for a deception COA — friendly collection must be ABLE to "
        "detect the spoof, or the COA is not actionable for the "
        "commander.",

        # ---- Distinguishability hard rule (ATP 2-01.3 ¶6-34 #4) ----
        "Each COA's distinguishing_characteristics MUST call out at "
        "least one observable signature (force composition / axis / "
        "timing / ammunition class / preparation indicator) that "
        "lets friendly collection disambiguate this COA from each of "
        "the other COAs in the set. For any COA carrying "
        "most_deceptive=True, distinguishing_characteristics MUST "
