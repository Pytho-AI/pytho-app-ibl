"""AGM — Attack Guidance Matrix — paras 2-22 – 2-26 + App. D Table D-3.

D3A Decide-phase product. Commander-approved matrix that prescribes WHEN
(planned / as-acquired / immediate), HOW (engagement means), EFFECTS
(suppress / neutralize / destroy), and REMARKS for every HPT. The AGM
synthesizes the HPTL + TSS gates with commander's targeting guidance into
the executable Decide artifact (paras 2-22 – 2-26).

paras 1-65 + 2-149 + Ch. 3 corroborate AGM as a DIVARTY-level
S-2 targeting section product issued by the commander; this schema is
echelon-agnostic and the preparing_unit / approving_commander header fields
carry the actual owners.
