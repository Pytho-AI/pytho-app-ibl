"""No-Strike List (NSL) — JP 3-60 Ch. III §B para 6(e); FM 3-60 paras 1-11 – 1-12.

The NSL is a list of entities — characterized as noncombatant in nature and
protected from the effects of military operations under international law and
ROE — that are off-limits to engagement. JP 3-60 explicitly states the NSL is
NOT a target list (Ch. III §B para 6(e)); it is the joint targeting cycle's
legal-protection filter. CCMDs with geographic responsibilities maintain an
NSL for their AOR ().

Doctrinal acronym: NSL appears verbatim in JP 3-60 (GL-2 and III-13 §(e)) and
in FM 3-60 (acronym list and paras 1-11 / 1-12).
