"""DSM — Decision Support Matrix — ATP 5-0 / FM 6-0.

Tier 2 fused product. The tabular companion to the DST (Decision Support
Template) — DST is the graphical overlay plotting decision points on
terrain; DSM is the tabulated companion listing each decision point with
its trigger event, named area of interest, commander decision, supporting
cell, and branch/sequel routing. Per ATP 5-0, the DSM is the working
copy carried by the staff during execution.
