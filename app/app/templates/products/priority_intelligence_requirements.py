"""PIR — Priority Intelligence Requirements — ATP 2-01 + ATP 2-01.3 + FM 6-0.

Commander-approved subset of intelligence requirements that critically
support decision-making. Per ATP 2-01.3 paras 1-28, 1-44, 2-20–2-25,
PIRs come out of IPOE Step 4 + MDMP Step 2, get commander-approved
in OPORD §3.b.2 / Annex B, and evolve per FRAGO as phases shift.

PIR is the PARENT of the collection-planning chain:

  PIR  →  ICM (Information Collection Matrix — PIR × Indicator × NAI × …)
       →  Event-Matrix (NAI × indicator × time × DP cross-tab)
       →  DST-Matrix (decision points whose triggers ARE PIR-answered conditions)
       →  ICSM (collection synchronization across phases)
       →  SITREP Line 7 (current PIRs in priority order)
       →  IRE Para 2.a (running PIR estimate)

Standalone XLSX product per the EXCEL_DOCTRINAL_ALIGNMENT.md doctrine:
working-group ledger sorted by priority, filterable by phase, edited
per FRAGO. Each PIR is a row.

XLSX as canonical (no DOCX/PPTX legacy) because PIRs are inherently
spreadsheet-shaped — sort/filter on phase/status/priority is the
analyst's daily workflow.
