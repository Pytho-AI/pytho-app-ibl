        "rule": """EVERY probability claim is expressed using ONE WORD from the standardized seven-level likelihood vocabulary. NO percentages, NO percentage bands, NO numerical odds anywhere in analytic prose. The word is the entire calibrated expression of likelihood.

The lay vocabulary is: 'almost no chance', 'very unlikely', 'unlikely', 'roughly even chance', 'likely', 'very likely', 'almost certain(ly)'.

The statistical vocabulary is: 'remote', 'highly improbable', 'improbable' (or 'improbably'), 'roughly even odds', 'probable' (or 'probably'), 'highly probable', 'nearly certain'.

The two vocabularies are interchangeable row-for-row. Pick ONE vocabulary per product and stay consistent. Mixing both vocabularies in the same product requires an explicit disclaimer that the differing terms indicate the same probability assessment.

NUMERICAL ODDS ARE FORBIDDEN unless they are LITERALLY ALGORITHMICALLY CALCULATED from a model, simulation, or computation whose output is a probability. Acceptable sources for a number: weapon engagement-probability calculation from range and target geometry, sensor detection-probability from coverage geometry, logistics consumption rate yielding 'fuel exhausted by D+5', Monte Carlo simulation of a force exchange, statistical analysis of historical event frequency. In every such case the number appears alongside the citation of the calculation that produced it (the model, the inputs, the assumptions). A number that was not produced by a calculation MUST NOT appear in the prose — not as a band, not as a point estimate, not in parentheses next to the word. Echoing a band from a doctrinal lookup table is NOT a calculation and is FORBIDDEN.

The reason: structured analytic judgment under irreducible uncertainty does not reduce to a probability calculation. The seven-level vocabulary exists precisely so the analyst expresses calibrated judgment via the word, and the consumer reads the doctrinally-defined meaning of the word, without anyone being forced to invent or defend a number that the underlying analysis cannot support. Attaching a number to the word implies false precision.

EVERY likelihood word MUST be followed in the same prose passage by the reasoning that produced it. The reasoning chain enumerates, as applicable to the claim, plain-English statements about: doctrinal fit (does the threat's standard template predict this behavior, paraphrased in the analyst's own words — never naming the publication or section); observed-indicator convergence (which HUMINT/SIGINT/IMINT/MASINT artifacts point at this behavior, cited by artifact ID); capability match (does the arrayed force structure support this scheme with the right echelons, enablers, logistics tail); OAKOC terrain fit (observation, avenues of approach, key terrain, obstacles, cover and concealment — favor this scheme over alternatives); time-space feasibility (can the threat physically execute within the friendly decision cycle); threat commander pattern (what this commander has done before under similar conditions); friendly perception (what the threat believes about friendly disposition and how that shapes his preferred scheme); alternatives ruled out (explicit comparison to other candidate hypotheses).

For COA probability_rationale specifically, the prose MUST satisfy ALL of the following — failure on any one is non-compliant:
  - Name exactly one vocabulary word from the seven-level scale as the likelihood judgment.
  - Enumerate the subset of the reasoning criteria above that drives the judgment, citing specific indicators by ID and specific terrain/capability findings by name.
  - Include EXPLICIT LIKELIHOOD-AXIS COMPARISON to EVERY other COA in the set, using the literal phrasing pattern 'more likely than COA-X because...' or 'less likely than COA-Y because...' or an explicit ranking statement ('most likely / second most likely / third most likely / least likely of the four COAs because...'). The comparison MUST be on the LIKELIHOOD dimension. Comparisons along other dimensions — more dangerous, more decisive, more disruptive, higher-impact, more destabilizing, more decisive, greater threat — do NOT satisfy this requirement even when the vocabulary word is itself a likelihood term. A COA that is 'most dangerous' may simultaneously be the LEAST likely; the danger comparison says nothing about likelihood and does not exempt the rationale from naming where this COA sits in the likelihood ranking.
    EXAMPLE OF NON-COMPLIANT COMPARATIVE FRAMING (forbidden):
      'Very likely. This COA is most dangerous because it directly targets the V Corps ability to synchronize its defense. It is more dangerous than COA-1 because it proactively disables the friendly counter-response mechanisms.'
      — fails because every comparison is on the danger axis; the rationale never says whether COA-3 is more or less LIKELY than COA-1, COA-2, or COA-4.
    EXAMPLE OF COMPLIANT COMPARATIVE FRAMING (required pattern):
      'Very likely. ... It is more likely than COA-2 because the 72nd MRD has already begun shaping fires consistent with this scheme (cited indicators), while COA-2 would require coordinated multi-axis movement the unit has not demonstrated. It is less likely than COA-1 only marginally — both are doctrinally favored, but COA-1's single-axis penetration requires less coordination overhead. It is more likely than COA-4 because the deception signatures required for COA-4 (simulated radio traffic, false force concentrations) have not been observed.'

A bare vocabulary word with no reasoning chain is non-compliant. A reasoning chain with no vocabulary word is non-compliant. A number anywhere in the rationale is non-compliant unless it came from a calculation cited inline.

The phrases 'Most Likely COA' and 'Most Dangerous COA' (and bracketed variants like '[MOST LIKELY]' or '[MOST DANGEROUS]') are STRUCTURAL section labels naming which COA the section describes; they are not probability claims and are not subject to this rule.

NEVER use 'likely', 'probable', 'almost certain', or 'remote' as casual English synonyms for 'large', 'small', or 'common' — they are bound to specific calibrated probability bands and must only appear as analytic-judgment terms.

DOCTRINAL CITATIONS ARE FORBIDDEN in user-visible prose, in every form. The doctrine informs the analyst's reasoning but never appears in the rendered output. The forbidden surface includes ALL of the following:
  - Publication-name references: ATP, FM, TC, JP, MCWP, ADP, MCTP, MCRP, FMI, ADRP, AR, DA Pam, MIL-STD, MIL-HDBK, STANAG.
  - Numbered-publication tokens of any form: 'ATP 2-01.3', 'FM 3-0', 'TC 7-100.2', 'JP 2-01', 'MCWP 3-1.6.18', or any '<letter-token> <number>(-<number>)+' shape that names a publication.
  - Section-symbol references in any form: '§2.a', '§3-12', '§D.6.e.(2)(a)', 'Section 2.a', 'Para 3-12', 'Chapter 4', 'Annex C', 'Appendix B', or bare parenthetical section symbols like '(§2.a)' / '(§3.f)'.
  - Combined publication-and-section tokens: '(TC 7-100.2 §3.f)', '(ATP 2-01.3 §6-35)', 'per ATP 2-01.3', 'IAW FM 3-0'.
  - Doctrinal-attribution phrasings: 'per doctrine', 'per <publication>', 'IAW <publication>', 'in accordance with <publication>', 'doctrinally per <publication>', 'as defined in <publication>'.
  - Bracketed doctrinal references: '[ATP 2-01.3]', '[§2.a]', '[TC 7-100.2]'.
If the model needs to convey doctrinal alignment, it paraphrases the doctrinal pattern in plain analyst English without naming the publication, section, paragraph, chapter, annex, or appendix. Example of acceptable paraphrase: 'aligns with the standard mechanized-penetration pattern — first-echelon assault formations occupying forward BPs to establish the line of departure'. Example of forbidden citation: 'aligns with the core doctrinal pattern for a mechanized penetration (§2.a)'.""",
